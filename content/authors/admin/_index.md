Hi, I am Yue (/yoo-eh/) Dong, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at [the University of California, Riverside](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at [McGill University](http://cs.mcgill.ca) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec), supervised by Dr. [Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). I was fortunate to intern at [Google AI](https://ai.google/), [AI2](https://allenai.org/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), and [Noah’s Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/) during my PhD.

My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I lead the Natural Language Processing group at UCR, which develops natural language understanding and generation systems that are controllable, trustworthy, and efficient. 

**Prospective Students** (Updated on March, 2024): Thank you for your interest! **I have 2 co-advised openings for self-motivated PhD candidates in the field of NLP+RL/theory and NLP+CV/robotics for Winter 2025 or Fall 2024.** If you are interested in working with me, please  fill out the [UCRNLP PhD application form](https://forms.gle/5pfWnBfMmaYLUUCs5) to highlight your potential in ML/NLP research and to assess the alignment with my research interests. Please understand that I will only respond to PhD email inquiries accompanied by a [completed form submission](https://forms.gle/5pfWnBfMmaYLUUCs5) due to the large amount of emails.

<!--
[apply officially](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/graduate/admissions/overview) by Jan. 5th 2024. Additionally, you may
I cannot advise more master's students at UCR in 24. Due to the high volume of requests, I won't be able to respond to further emails on this matter. -->
